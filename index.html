            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>In our IDM 216, UX Design II class, our team worked collaboratively over the span of 10 weeks in order to finalize and develop the Happy Sunshine Mobile application design, which was created in the previous class, IDM 215. This was another team based project, where collaboration and communication were of the essence. Seeing as the design of the application was nearly complete, our team made sure to finalize this by gathering previous research materials as well as using the stylesheet provided by the initial design team. We also delved into further usability testing in order to collect any remaining feedback that potential users, designers, developers and more had. Our team went through three phases, alpha, beta, and final, which also helped us to ultimately see what we had to prioritize, leading up to the final build. With the designs as the primary guide, the developers were able to revise, add, and improve to each phase of the build, in order to produce a branded application for the Happy Sunshine food truck, and a seamless user experience for the users.</p>

            <h2>Context & Challenge</h2>
            <p>As students of Drexel University, we knew that the Happy Sunshine food truck has a strong and growing customer base. However, we also knew that at times, customers with busy schedules would have to wait in long lines to get their food. The initial research was completed by the team that designed the application in the previous term. That being said, it was our team’s responsibility to build a product that would not only convey the happy and friendly feeling of the truck, but also a product that would be seamless and beneficial for the target users. Over the course of 10 weeks, our team finalized the design, obtained final feedback through usability testing, and developed the Happy Sunshine application. Maintaining the critical task flow was of utmost importance for our team, and we were able to improve the user’s navigation through the screens with each phase of the build. Working in a team setting was definitely helpful for this project. As the Coder and UX Designer of the team, it was important for me to be able to communicate, design, test, and build alongside the team members. More specifically, I focused on not only conducting usability testing, but also helping the primary coder with developing microinteractions.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Maintain and improve a seamless experience from customizing a selected food item to obtaining the food item through the application</li>
                <li>Develop a dynamic web application that is consistent with application design and brand</li>

            <h2>Process & Insight</h2>
            <p>Each week, our team had either one or two meetings in order to update each other with the progress made by the team members as well as to voice any opinions, concerns, questions, and more. In the first few weeks, our team established the roles of each member along with the respective responsibilities. We also gathered design and research materials that were completed by the previous design and research team. This included the stylesheet, user persona, and the journey map.</p>

            <p>As mentioned before, our process was essentially divided into three phases: alpha, beta, and final. The alpha build was developed using primarily HTML and CSS, with the implementation of final images as well as a complete flow between all the pages. The beta build would be an improved version of the alpha, with additional microinteractions, functional input fields, and at least one database implementation. The final build would be the fully functioning and styled web application, with all the necessary database implementation, working Javascript, and a responsive build. For the beta and the final build, the UX designers conducted 8 different usability testing in total. We also received a critique for each phase of the build. Both forms of feedback were quite helpful for us to produce the best possible outcome of the Happy Sunshine application.</p>

                <h3>Microinteractions</h3>
                <p>As one of the coders, I primarily focused on the microinteractions that would and could be integrated into the final build. Using Codepen, I would look at works done by different users that were similar to the microinteractions that we needed for our application. In order to create these microinteractions to complement our application, I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make it as stylized and as functional as possible. Below are some of the microinteractions that I’ve created.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Our final build is a combination of everything, from design elements to prioritized feedback and more, that our team had obtained within the 10 week period. It provides users with an efficient, convenient, and seamless experience for them to order and get their food with little to no frustrations or difficulties. The primary coder and I were able to communicate as much as possible to not only collaborate, but also learn as we went through the design and developing processes alongside the team.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>From the beginning stages of the development, to the final build with database integration, our product was definitely a success. All the necessary elements, which include brand style, navigation, functionality, responsiveness, and overall convenience are evident in our final build. With our application, users would be able to get the experience of the critical task flow of customizing and ordering their food items right from their phones. With this project, I was able to gain insight of working in a team setting where collaboration and communication were keys to success. In future projects, I hope to be able to work closer with the coders of the team in order to work together and code the application on VSCode, where having more than one person coding on a single repository isn’t available.</p>
